# Vietnam Outdoor Adventures (VietnamADV)

A comprehensive platform showcasing Vietnam's outdoor adventure opportunities, including trail running, hiking, climbing, and guided experiences across the country's diverse landscapes.

## 🏔️ Project Overview

VietnamADV is a static website built with Astro that serves as a resource hub for outdoor enthusiasts looking to explore Vietnam's natural beauty. The platform provides detailed guides, route information, and curated adventure experiences across various outdoor activities.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Astro](https://astro.build/) - A modern static site builder with excellent performance
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Interactivity**: [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) - Lightweight JavaScript framework for minimal client-side interactions
- **Content**: Markdown-based content collections with typed schemas
- **Maps**: [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) - Open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Content Management**:
   - Content is stored as Markdown files in the `src/content/` directory
   - Each activity type (hiking, climbing, trail-running) has its own collection
   - Content schemas are defined in `src/content/config.ts` using Zod for type validation

2. **Page Generation**:
   - Astro generates static pages at build time from the content collections
   - Dynamic routes (e.g., `/hiking/[slug]`) are created for each content entry
   - Content is rendered into page templates with consistent layouts

3. **User Experience**:
   - Users can browse activities by category (hiking, climbing, trail running)
   - Interactive maps show trail locations and routes using Leaflet.js
   - Alpine.js provides minimal client-side interactivity for components like the newsletter form and FAQ accordions

## 🧩 Main Features

- **Activity Guides**: Detailed information about trails, climbing spots, and routes
- **Interactive Maps**: Visual representation of trails and adventure locations
- **Photo Galleries**: Showcasing the beauty of each location
- **Filtering System**: Allows users to filter activities by difficulty, duration, and location
- **Newsletter Subscription**: Captures user emails for updates (client-side only)
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all device sizes

## 🔌 Integration Points

- **Map Integration**: Uses Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap for displaying trail maps
- **Image Hosting**: External image hosting via Unsplash (placeholder images)
- **Contact Form**: Client-side form handling with Alpine.js (no backend processing yet)

## 🚀 Deployment

The site is configured for static deployment with the following options:

- **Development**: Local development server on port 5000
- **Production**: Static site generation for deployment to any static hosting service
- **Replit**: Configuration for Replit development and hosting environment

## 🧠 Architecture Decisions

1. **Static Site Generation**: Chosen for performance, security, and simplified hosting
2. **Content Collections**: Structured content with type validation for maintainability
3. **Minimal JavaScript**: Focus on performance with limited client-side JavaScript
4. **Component-Based Design**: Reusable components for consistent UI and easier maintenance

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

- Backend integration for newsletter and contact form processing
- User accounts and saved favorites
- Integration with booking systems for guided adventures
- Weather API integration for real-time conditions
- User-generated content and reviews
