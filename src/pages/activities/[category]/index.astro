            <h3 class="text-forest">Northern Vietnam</h3>
            <p><strong>Best:</strong> September to November and March to May<br>
            <strong>Why:</strong> Moderate temperatures, lower humidity, and less rainfall make for ideal running conditions. Fall offers golden rice terraces while spring brings vibrant green fields.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-forest">Central Vietnam</h3>
            <p><strong>Best:</strong> January to August<br>
            <strong>Why:</strong> Avoid the late-year rainy season when trails can become slippery and dangerous. February to May offers pleasant temperatures before summer heat.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-forest">Southern Vietnam</h3>
            <p><strong>Best:</strong> December to April<br>
            <strong>Why:</strong> The dry season brings lower humidity and minimal rain, making trails more accessible and running more comfortable.</p>
            
            <p>For any region, starting early in the morning helps avoid heat during warmer months. Trail events and organized races typically occur in the cooler months between November and March.</p>

            <p class="font-medium">Hiking conditions vary significantly across Vietnam's regions due to distinct climate patterns:</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-forest">Northern Mountains (Sapa, Ha Giang, Cao Bang)</h3>
            <p><strong>Prime Season:</strong> September to November and March to May<br>
            <strong>Why:</strong> Clear skies, comfortable temperatures, and stunning scenery. Fall brings golden rice harvests, while spring showcases blooming flowers and green terraces.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-forest">Central Highlands (Dalat, Kon Tum)</h3>
            <p><strong>Prime Season:</strong> November to April<br>
            <strong>Why:</strong> Dry conditions with cooler temperatures, especially from December to February. The highland climate remains relatively comfortable year-round.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-forest">Coastal and Southern Regions</h3>
            <p><strong>Prime Season:</strong> December to April<br>
            <strong>Why:</strong> The dry season brings stable weather patterns and less humidity, making coastal mountain hikes more accessible.</p>
            
            <p>Avoid the rainy season (May-September in the north, September-December in central Vietnam) when trails become slippery and leeches are abundant. For any multi-day trek, hiring local guides is recommended for both navigation and cultural insights.</p>

            <p><strong>Prime Season:</strong> October to April<br>
            <strong>Why:</strong> Cooler temperatures and lower humidity provide better friction on limestone. November to March offers the driest conditions but can be chilly.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-forest">Central Vietnam (Marble Mountains, Hue)</h3>
            <p><strong>Prime Season:</strong> February to August<br>
            <strong>Why:</strong> Avoid the heavy rains of fall and early winter. March to May typically offers the best balance of dry conditions and moderate temperatures.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-forest">Deep Water Soloing</h3>
            <p><strong>Prime Season:</strong> April to October<br>
            <strong>Why:</strong> Warmer water temperatures and typically calmer seas, especially important for safety when climbing without ropes over water.</p>
            
            <p>For any climbing trip, it's worth noting that humidity can affect rock friction significantly. Early morning sessions often provide the best conditions, especially during hotter months. Many crags in Vietnam are still being developed, so connecting with local climbing communities can provide the most current information on routes and access.</p>
