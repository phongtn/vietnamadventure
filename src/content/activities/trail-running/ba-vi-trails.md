# Ba Vi Mountain Trail Circuit

The Ba Vi Mountain Trail Circuit offers a challenging but rewarding running experience through one of northern Vietnam's most accessible natural areas, just 60km from Hanoi city center.

## Trail Highlights

Ba Vi National Park features three peaks on a mountain range that appears as a "sleeping lady" from a distance. This trail circuit takes you through diverse ecosystems and offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside:

- Dense subtropical forests with over 1,200 plant species
- Misty mountain trails with dramatic changes in vegetation
- Historic French hill station ruins
- Ancient temples at various points along the route
- Panoramic views of the Red River Valley

## Route Description

The 18km loop begins at the main park entrance and quickly ascends through bamboo forests into the higher elevations. The trail alternates between well-maintained stone paths near popular attractions and more technical single-track trails through less-visited areas.

The steepest section comes around the 7km mark as you approach the highest accessible peak. The trail then traverses along the ridge offering spectacular views before beginning the descent through an entirely different ecosystem.

## Technical Difficulty

This trail earns its "Hard" rating due to:
- Significant elevation gain (800m)
- Several technical sections with loose rocks and roots
- Steep descents that require careful footing
- Variable weather conditions that can make trails slippery

## When to Run

Ba Vi is accessible year-round but offers different experiences:
- **Winter (Nov-Feb)**: Clearest views but can be very cold at higher elevations
- **Spring (Mar-Apr)**: Pleasant temperatures with mountain flowers in bloom
- **Summer (May-Aug)**: Lush greenery but hot and humid with occasional thunderstorms
- **Autumn (Sep-Oct)**: Moderate temperatures and good visibility

The mountain creates its own microclimate, often being enveloped in mist while surrounding areas are clear. Early morning runs provide the best chance of clear views.

## Essential Information

- **Entrance Fee**: 60,000 VND per person
- **Opening Hours**: 6:00 AM - 7:00 PM
- **Facilities**: Restrooms and small shops at the entrance and main temple areas
- **Cell Service**: Limited on most of the trail
- **Water**: Bring at least 2L as there are limited refill opportunities

Ba Vi provides a perfect escape from Hanoi's hustle and heat, offering serious trail runners a challenging route through a unique ecological and historical landscape.
