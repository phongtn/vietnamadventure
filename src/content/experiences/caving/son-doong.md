# Son Doong Cave Expedition

Discovered in 1991 by a local farmer but not fully explored until 2009, Son Doong (Mountain River Cave) is now recognized as the world's largest cave. This extraordinary underground world features passages that reach up to 200 meters high and 150 meters wide, large enough to house an entire New York City block with 40-story skyscrapers.

## The Ultimate Caving Experience

Son Doong is not merely a cave but an entire underground world with:

- Vast chambers that could fit entire buildings

- 80-meter tall stalagmites, the tallest in the world
- Ancient fossilized marine creatures embedded in the walls
- Rare cave pearls formed over millennia
