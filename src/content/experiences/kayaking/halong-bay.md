# Halong Bay Kayaking Expedition

While thousands of tourists cruise through Halong Bay on large boats, kayaking offers a more intimate experience of this natural wonder. Paddling through the emerald waters allows you to access hidden corners, observe wildlife up close, and experience the magnitude of the limestone formations from water level.
