# Huu Lung Climbing Area

Huu Lung, located in Lang Son Province approximately 110km northeast of Hanoi, represents the cutting edge of Vietnam's rock climbing development. This relatively new climbing destination features pristine limestone karst formations rising dramatically from lush rice paddies, creating a climbing experience that combines world-class routes with authentic rural Vietnam atmosphere.

## Overview

Discovered by climbers only in 2016, Huu Lung has quickly developed into a premier climbing area with over 150 routes established across multiple sectors. The area features immaculate limestone with diverse climbing styles including vertical technical faces, tufa-riddled overhangs, and dramatic stalactites.

Unlike more touristy climbing destinations in Vietnam, Huu Lung retains its authentic rural character. Climbers here share the landscape with farmers tending rice fields and buffalo grazing beneath the cliffs, creating a uniquely Vietnamese climbing experience.

## Main Climbing Sectors

### 1. The Fishbowl

**Highlights:**
- The most developed sector with 50+ routes
- Wide range of difficulties from 5.9 to 5.13d (5c to 8b)
- Climbing above a picturesque lake
- All-day sun protection from heat

The Fishbowl is Huu Lung's showcase wall, featuring a curved amphitheater of limestone rising above a small lake. The wall offers routes of all difficulties, from beginner-friendly vertical climbs with positive holds to severely overhanging lines requiring strength and technical prowess. The sector's orientation provides shade throughout most of the day, making it climbable even during warmer months.

#### Notable Routes:
- **"Rice Farmer's Warm-Up"** - 5.10a (6a), 25m: Perfect introduction to Huu Lung limestone with varied movement on good holds

- **"Project Alpha"** - 5.13d (8b), 35m: The area's test piece, featuring sustained difficulty on small crimps and pockets

### 2. Buffalo Wall

**Highlights:**
- Accessible, slightly overhanging wall

Buffalo Wall is perfect for climbers seeking moderate routes on quality limestone. This sector features shorter routes (15-25m) on slightly overhanging terrain with plentiful holds. The cliff base often hosts grazing water buffalo, creating unique climbing photos. The wall receives morning shade, making it ideal for starting early on hot days.

#### Notable Routes:
